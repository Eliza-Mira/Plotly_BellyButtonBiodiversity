## Belly Button Biodiversity
https://eliza-mira.github.io/Plotly_BellyButtonBiodiversity/

*A team of biological researchers is currently engaged in a study aimed at identifying and cataloging bacteria. Their focus is on finding a particular bacteria species capable of producing proteins that mimic the taste of beef. The intention is to provide an alternative option to beef products. This specific bacteria has been discovered on the human body, primarily in the belly button region. However, further data collection and analysis are required to advance the research.*

*To facilitate the exploration of the Belly Button Biodiversity research project, an interactive dashboard has been developed. This dashboard enables both researchers and volunteers to delve into the project's data. Users have the ability to identify the top 10 bacterial species present in the belly buttons of anonymous volunteers. The dashboard includes various visual representations such as a bar chart, which displays the top 10 bacterial species, a gauge chart that visualizes how frequently individuals cleanse their belly buttons, and a bubble chart showcasing all the contained bacteria.*
